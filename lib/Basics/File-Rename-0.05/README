File-Rename version 0.05
========================

File::Rename provides an implementation of Larry Wall's eg/rename command.
All I have done is added some error checking and (more recently) added the
File/Rename.pm module.  An earlier version of the script is out in the
Internet and is included with some linuxes, and the original eg/rename is
not included in the Perl distribution, so I have put this up on CPAN.

For Windows, the script is called file-rename to avoid clashes with existing
rename command.
 
 
INSTALLATION

To install this module type the following:

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test
   make install

or if you have Module::Build

   perl Build.PL
   perl Build
   perl Build test
   perl Build install

    
DEPENDENCIES

This module requires these other modules and libraries:
File::Basename File::Path File::Spec Getopt::Long
(all included with Perl). 

Testing requires File::Temp and Test::More which are
available with perl 5.6.0.  I have successfully installed
those modules for perl 5.005_05 and tested this module.
